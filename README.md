## 🌍 About the Project

The kit was developed by [Ethafa](https://www.ethafa.com) to support playful and meaningful engagement with electronics, coding, and storytelling — particularly within Arabic-speaking and multicultural communities. It has been used in workshops across Switzerland, Gulf Countries and internationally.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Build the kit**  
   Use the 3D files and PCB source files to manufacture the hardware. Moreover, you can use the "Version with no PCB" to run the activities with simple electronics components.

2. **Run the activities**  
   Open the `Activity` folder for guided activities using the Ethafa board.  
   For NoPCB version refer to the folder "Resources for Educators"

3. **Customize**  
   Educators and designers can use the Ethafa Framework to develop new culturally grounded activities. Please share your creation using the same licence.
